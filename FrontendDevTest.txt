REACT / Website - UI Test

Skillset 1-2 React State

1) Create a calculator form with inputs for “Monthly Payments”, “Principal”, “Rate”, “Compounds per Year”, 
and a label for the resulting “Loan Payment” calculation. 

2) Use the values from the 4 inputs to calculate the loan payment using this formula:
 (Principal*Rate/100/Compounds per year)/(1-(1+Rate/100/Compounds per year)^(-Monthly Payments)).

2.1) This calculation should automatically update when any value changes from the inputs (because it’s using React state).

2.2) The Loan Payment function can be substituted for any calculation you would like to perform.

3) Create a component in a second file that takes a function as a parameter that will change its parent’s state. IE: input element, dropdown control, or button.

NOTE: Everything should be strongly typed (using typescript).

Deliverable: Single page web application with the UI components described above.
